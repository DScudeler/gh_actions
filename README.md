# gh_actions
Project to test github actions with Claude, project test and deployment.

From a small wasm project in rust, Claude is tested to develop a small web app with embedded wasm app that opens a SQLite file to manage tasks. Github actions are used to call for Claude, run tests and deploy. The git management will be light git flow, each dev having its own branchement.

The task management app will also display KPI regarding time to do, remaining, estimated etc... more features to come.
